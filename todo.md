## Initial Setup and Character Creation

- Edit character json to include era and more detail on appearance (skin color).
- Generate multiple people in one go.
- Ensure personalities do not contradict each other. Randomly choose using random.randint() 5 and cross reference them to conflicting personalities. If any conflicts are found, then pick more.
- Determine if the prompt for name needs to say randomized because we see Lucius a lot.

## Social Network and Hierarchy

- Create connections between NPCs.
- Redo social hierarchy because it is reading emperor first.
- Create a social graph using a reputation scale between -1, 1.
- Explore using Neo4j, vector databases or traditional SQL for social network graphs.

## Environment and Interaction

- Edit the prompt.json to be more about environment.
- Revised character messaging prompt. It is working but the output is not as expected. Need to take a look at gradio again maybe (5/13).
- Finished working on character messaging and prompting (5/20).
